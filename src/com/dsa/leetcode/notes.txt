Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105

    if constraints are like this:
        we should use long to sum up the elements otherwise we will get integer overflow



prompt - to generate java docs

Can you add comprehensive JavaDocs for each method in this class? For each method, please include:
A clear and concise summary of what the method does
The intuition and reasoning behind the approach used
A step-by-step explanation of the algorithm or logic
Detailed descriptions of all parameters and the return value
An explicit analysis of time and space complexity (add <br> before each so they appear on separate lines)
Any edge cases or important considerations relevant to the method
Ensure the documentation is clear, professional, and suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.
