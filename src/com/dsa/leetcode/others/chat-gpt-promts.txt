 * <b>Algorithm:</b>
 * <pre>
 * 1. Iterate through each possible starting index `i`.
 * 2. For each starting index, iterate through the array to calculate subarray sums.
 * 3. If the sum equals `k`, update the maximum subarray length.

to ask top questions in specific topic:

"You are an experienced interviewer with 20 years of expertise in conducting Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) interview rounds.

I am a candidate with 3 years of experience preparing for DSA interviews. I will provide you with a specific DSA topic. Your task is to generate a list of the top 15 to 20 interview questions for that topic.

Please categorize these questions by difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard. For each question, briefly explain why it's considered to be of that difficulty level (e.g., common pattern, specific optimization required, advanced concept). Also, provide a brief hint or the core concept needed to solve each problem, without revealing the full solution.
